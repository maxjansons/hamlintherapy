        <h3>Welcome!</h3>
        <p>

            I’m a queer/trans therapist who is passionate about creating collaborative therapeutic relationships that center consent and feedback from you. <br> <br>

            I have a mutual aid background related to prison abolition, sex work, disability, and trans healthcare. My approach is influenced by antiracism, anticapitalism, fat activist, queer/trans affirming, and disability centered lenses. I believe that healing happens in relationship/community and encourage healthy conflict. <br> <br>

            My therapeutic style is compatible with individuals and relational units looking to deepen their sense of self, create and maintain boundaries, and set short and longer-term goals. I’m interested in working with clients that value an abolitionist and anti-oppressive lens being brought into their healing work. I love working with individuals, couples, families, small groups, polycules, siblings, friends, ect. <br> <br>

            I offer sliding scale rates based on need/marginalized identity. I'm open to weekly, biweekly, or monthly appointment frequency and happy to adjust that up and down over time. I’m covid-cautious and see clients through telehealth.<br> <br>
